# Jav

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/jav)](https://npm.im/jav)

Really appreciate [Stephen Shank](https://github.com/stephenshank) gift the package name **jav** to this repo.

Jav is a [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/) style validator, and the underlying implementation is [async-validator](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator).

## Features

- All api same as [async-validator](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator), but change to **chaining** called.
- **Small enough** for browser, otherwise [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/) is too big.
- More readable and writable for developer. I hate code more and more object.
- Full **typescript** support. Even get the real transformed type from schema.

## Install

```bash
npm install jav --save
```
